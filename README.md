# homesweethome. mark bao's dotfiles.

these are mine. you are free to take them ^_^

## how this work?

I don't do the whole symlink thing, because... screw that. git clone things, man. and then it's done.

at first, git will want to commit everything in your home directory. to prevent this, edit `~/.git/info/exclude` and add a `*` at the last line of the file.

## todo

* <strike>move away from nvie's vim ish. as much as i love nvie. i like having mai own vim dotfiles.</strike> OMG DONE
* put in more plugins to vim
