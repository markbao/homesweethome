# homesweethome. mark bao's dotfiles.

These are my dotfiles, mostly for vim and zsh. They're very customized to my own workflow, but feel free to use them if you wish!

At first, I shunned using the symlink dotfiles approach, because I thought it was silly. Until I found out that putting a `.git` in your home directory was not only silly, but just plain dumb.

Now, I clone this repo to a directory `~/.dot` and symlink `.vim`, `.vimrc`, `.zshrc`, `.oh-my-zsh`, `.gemrc`, and other requisite files.
